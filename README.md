## Deployment

The hosting platform that I've used for my project is GitHub Pages.
To deploy my website to GitHub pages, I used the following steps:

1. Initialised Git using the git init command.

2. Added all files to the Staging area (Git) using the git add . command.

3. Committed the files to Git using the git commit -m "Initial commit" command.

4. From IDE shared the project called **ecommerce** which automatically create a Repository with same name in
   GitHub.

5. First Commit the code changes into GitHub using IDE git tool

6. Regularly committed the code changes using same tool
